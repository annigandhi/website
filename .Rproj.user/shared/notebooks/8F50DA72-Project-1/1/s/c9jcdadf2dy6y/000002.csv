"0","##The epilepsy and seizure datasets are r datasets that detail the results of a randomized clinical trial for patients with epileptic seizures. The clinical trial tested the effects that being on a anti-epileptic drug, Progabide, or a placebo had on the patients' seizure rates. There were 59 patients that participated in the trial. The dataset seizure has a row for each patient with their age, treatment type (0 or 1), an ID variable, and a count of the number of baseline seizures that occured in an 8 week period before the start of the trial. "

"0","##The epilepsy dataset contains four rows for each of the 59 patients. It seperates each patient's 8 weeks during the trial into 4 periods of two weeks. The ""period"" column of this dataset indicates which two week period of the trial that row accounts for and the corresponding ""seizure.rate"""" column shows how many seizures that individual had during each 2 week period. This dataset also had age, baseline, and identifying columns as well as a categorical treatment column.  "

"0","##With these two datasets, I wanted to see how much of a difference there was in seizure rates for those taking the drug and those not taking the drug compared to their baseline value. I also wanted to see how the seizure rate differed from period 1-4 (throughout the length of the trial) and by age. This could have a relation to my future career as a physician if I am involved in clinical trials for my patients. This data is already tidy and ready to be joined. "
