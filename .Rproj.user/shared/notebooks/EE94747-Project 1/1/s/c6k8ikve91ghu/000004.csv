"0","##This plot shows the number of seizures per two week period versus the age of the individual color-coded by treatment type. We can see that the number of seizures does not differ significantly in patients of different age. There does to be a slightly lower number of seizures for those in the blue that were on the anti-seizure medication, however there is not a drastic enough trend here that we can make any definitive claims on its effectiveness. We can also see that there are more high outliers for those on the drug, showing a possible negative side effect or reaction. I changed the color and moved the legend for the treatment variable to the left-hand-side of the plot. "
