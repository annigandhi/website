### **Adventures and Travels**

Something else that I wanted to highlight on this site that is a huge part of my life are the travels that I have been fortunate enough to have been on! Ever since I was a child, my parents and family friends have toted me along to the craziest of places, from Alaska, to South Africa, to Thailand. 

When I travel, I love to take the opportunity to enjoy nature and appreciate the culture of the people I encounter. 

Below are a few examples of places and experiences I have had in the last few years. 

**Mission Trip**

During my freshman year of college, I was given the opportunity to travel to the Dominican Republic through an organization called Global Medical Training as part of a medical mission trip. I really enjoyed this experience because it combined my passions for medicine and health with my desire to understand more about people living in different places.

**Aruba**

One of my favorite vacations I have been on was my family's trip to Aruba. Although where we were staying was on a commercialized-Americanized strip of restaurants and hotels, when we took the opportunity to see the more rugged side of the island we were greeted with some of the most beautiful scenes in nature I have ever experienced.

**Ecuador**

Lastly, was our trip to Ecuador in winter of 2018. I was so excited to be visiting South America for the first time, and was captivated by the nature to withhold in the Amazon rainforest and even in Quito. On the adventurous side of things, my brother and I repelled down waterfalls with just a single rope and pulley system! Honestly one of my most terrifying experiences, but made us feel extremely accomplished.
