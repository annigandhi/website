      <description>##My Projects:
These are the projects I have completed thus far:
  Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis; Description: This exploratory data project was used to compare two sets of data in order to analyze trends and correlations. Dplyr functions were used to create summary functions and ggplot was used to create visualizations of the data. This project was completed in R.
  Project 2 - Modeling; Description: In this project, the focus was modeling of the dataset.</description>
