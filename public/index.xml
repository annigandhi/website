      <description>Adventures and Travels Something else that I wanted to highlight on this site that is a huge part of my life are the travels that I have been fortunate enough to have been on! Ever since I was a child, my parents and family friends have toted me along to the craziest of places, from Alaska, to South Africa, to Thailand.
When I travel, I love to take the opportunity to enjoy nature and appreciate the culture of the people I encounter.</description>

      <description>Introduction In SDS 348: Computational Biology and BioInformatics, we spent a portion of the end of the course learning Python. Python is a programming language that is very versatile and allows for a wide range of complexity while still being user-friendly. Whatâ€™s unique about this coding language is that it is very capable of interacting with other languages and platforms due to the usage of third party modules that can be incorporated.</description>

These are the projects I have completed thus far:
  Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis; Description: This exploratory data project was used to compare two sets of data in order to analyze trends and correlations. Dplyr functions were used to create summary functions and ggplot was used to create visualizations of the data. This project was completed in R.
  Project 2 - Modeling; Description: In this project, the focus was modeling of the dataset.</description>
